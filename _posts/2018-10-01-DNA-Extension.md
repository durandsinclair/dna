Dear Professor Awati,

I’d like to request an extension on Assignment 1c on account of it being too complicated for my DNA.

A recent meta-analysis (Liu et al, 2013a) found that human DNA is among the more complex in the global taxonomy of life, 
containing around 690 megabytes of information (1 base pair being 2 bits, with humans having 2.9 billion base pairs.) 
However, only a small fraction of that is coded into proteins.

...

In fact, only 37 million base pairs are used to code proteins, which amounts to a mere 8.7 megabytes of information 
(Liu et al, 2013b).

By contrast, the Word documents we have to read for assignment 1c add up to 937 kilobytes, which is nearly an eighth as
complicated as I am.

...

Therefore, I might need a bit more time to get through it.

To help see the extent of the problem, I’ve made a handy data viz that allows you to compare the information contained in 
Assignment 1c to the information needed to create various forms of life. As you can see, the assignment is slightly more 
complex than a botulism bacterium (787 kB) but not quite as bad as E. coli (962 kB).

...


I attach references below, and humbly request an extension.

Sincerely,
Durand
